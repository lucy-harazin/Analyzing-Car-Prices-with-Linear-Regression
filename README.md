# Analyzing-Car-Prices-with-Linear-Regression
A data analysis done in Python of factors that influence car prices using linear regression

## Overview
This project uses linear regression techniques to analyze and predict car prices. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.

## Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn
```
## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucy-harazin/Analyzing-Car-Prices-with-Linear-Regression.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Analyzing-Car-Prices-with-Linear-Regression
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Analyzing Car Prices with Linear Regression.ipynb"
```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.

## Project Structure
- Analyzing Car Prices with Linear Regression.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and model building.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes information on various car features and their prices.

## Results
The analysis includes:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between car features and prices.
- Building and evaluating a linear regression model to predict car prices.
- Visualizations of the model's performance and key insights.
